<br><b id="c">5. C</b><br>
<i>The C programming language is a procedural and general-purpose language that provides low-level access to system memory. A program written in C must be run through a C compiler to convert it into an executable that a computer can run. Many versions of Unix-based operating systems (OSes) are written in C and it has been standardized as part of the Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX).</i>
<h2>Pros and cons of C</h2>
<i>The C language comes with a set of special characteristics, making it one of the most widely used languages of all time. The following are the main benefits of using C:</i>
<ul>
    <li>Structured- It offers a structured programming approach for breaking down problems into smaller modules or functions that are easy to understand and modify.</li>
<li>Portable- C is machine-independent and C programs can be executed on different machines.</li>
<li>Mid-level programming language- It's a mid-level language that supports the features of both a low-level and a high-level language.</li>
<li>Rich library- It offers numerous built-in library functions that expedite the development process.</li>
<li>Dynamic memory allocation- C supports the dynamic memory allocation feature, which can be used to free the allocated memory at any time by calling the free() function.</li>
<li>Speed- It's a compiler-based language, which makes the compilation and execution of code faster. Since only essential and required features are included in C, it saves processing power and improves speed.</li>
<li>Pointers- C uses pointers, which improve performance by enabling direct interaction with the system memory.</li>
<li>Recursion- C enables developers to backtrack by providing code reusability for every function.</li>
<li>Extensible- A C program can be easily extended. If code is already written, new features and functionalities can be added to it with minor alterations.</li>
</ul>
<i>C also comes with a few shortfalls, even though it's an ideal language for programming beginners due to its simple syntax, algorithms and modular structure. The following are a few disadvantages of using C:</i>
<ul>
    <li>OOP features- C doesn't extend its support for object-oriented programming (OOP) features, which enables the creation of subclasses from parent classes. Unlike Java, Python or C++, multiple inheritances can't be created in C, which makes it difficult to reuse existing code.</li>
<li>Namespace feature- C lacks namespace features, which means the same variable name can't be reused in one scope. Without namespaces, it's impossible to declare two variables with the same name.</li>
<li>Run-time checking- C doesn't display code errors after each line of code; instead, all the errors are presented by the compiler after the program has been written. This can make code-checking a challenge, especially for larger programs.</li>
<li>Exception handling- C lacks exception handling, which is the ability to handle exceptions, such as bugs and anomalies that can happen during source code</li>
<li>Constructor and destructor- Since C isn't object-oriented, it doesn't offer constructor and destructor features. Constructing or destructing a variable in C must be done manually through a function or by other means.</li>
<li>Garbage collection- C isn't equipped with garbage collection. This important feature automatically reclaims memory from objects that are no longer required by the library or an app.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Uses of C</h2>
<i>C has a wide range of real-world applications that aren't limited to the development of OSes and applications. C is also used in areas such as graphical user interface development and integrated development environments. The following are some use cases for the C language:</i>
<ul>
    <li>OSes, such as Unix and all Unix applications</li>
    <li>databases, including Oracle Database, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server and PostgreSQL, which are partially written in C</li>
<li>language compilers, including the C compiler</li>
<li>text editors</li>
<li>print spoolers</li>
<li>assemblers</li>
<li>network drivers</li>
<li>modern programs, such as Git and FreeBSD</li>
<li>language interpreters</li>
<li>utilities, such as network drivers, mouse drivers and keyboard drivers</li>

</ul>
