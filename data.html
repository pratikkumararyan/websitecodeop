<br><h1>Data</h1>
<h3>In computing, data is information that has been translated into a form that is efficient for movement or processing. Relative to today's computers and transmission media, data is information converted into binary digital form. It is acceptable for data to be used as a singular subject or a plural subject.</h3>
<h2>Data Handling</h2>
<p>Data handling is the process of ensuring that research data is stored, archived or disposed of safely and securely during and after the conclusion of a research project. This includes the development of policies and procedures to manage data handled electronically as well as through non-electronic means.</p>
<br>
<p>Data handling is important in ensuring the integrity of research data since it addresses concerns related to confidentially, security, and preservation/retention of research data. Proper planning for data handling can also result in efficient and economical storage, retrieval, and disposal of data. In the case of data handled electronically, data integrity is a primary concern to ensure that recorded data is not altered, erased, lost or accessed by unauthorized users.</p>
<br>
<p>Data handling issues encompass both electronic as well as non-electronic systems, such as paper files, journals, and laboratory notebooks. Electronic systems include computer workstations and laptops, personal digital assistants (PDA), and storage media such as videotape, diskette, CD, DVD, memory cards, and other electronic instrumentation. These systems may be used for storage, archival, sharing, and disposal of data, and therefore, require adequate planning at the start of a research project so that issues related to data integrity can be analyzed and addressed early on.</p>
<br>
<b>Considerations/issues in data handling</b><br>

<b>Issues that should be considered in ensuring the integrity of data handled include the following:</b>

<ul>
<li>Type of data handled and its impact on the environment (especially if it is on a toxic media).</li>
<li>Type of media containing data and its storage capacity, handling and storage requirements, reliability, longevity (in the case of degradable medium), retrieval effectiveness, and ease of upgrade to newer media.</li>
<li>Data handling responsibilities/privileges, that is, who can handle which portion of data, at what point during the project, for what purpose, etc.</li>
<li>Data handling procedures that describe how long the data should be kept, and when, how, and who should handle data for storage, sharing, archival, retrieval and disposal purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Deciding how long research data should be kept may depend on the nature of the project, sponsoring agencyâ€™s guidelines, ongoing interest in or need for the data, the cost of maintaining the data in the long run, and other relevant considerations. Under current Health and Human Services requirements, research records must be maintained for at least three years after the last expenditure report. Federal regulations or institutional guidelines may require that data be retained for longer periods.</p><br>


<p>In the case of data stored electronically, the potential for altering, erasing, losing, or unauthorized access is high. Several years of valuable research data can be compromised or lost as happened in April 2001, when an intruder broke into a server used by a group of University of Washington graduate students and deleted the entire file system (UoW website, 2003). Although some aspects of protection from these threats are the responsibility of IT professionals, researchers are ultimately responsible for ensuring the security of their data.</p><br>


<p>Creating a secure environment for electronic data usually involves all members of a project, which can include an IT Manager, system administrator, support personnel, and several end-users. Some issues to consider when handling data electronically include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Protect systems and individual files with login and passwords.</li>
<li>Manage access rights (in the case of computer system administrators not involved in the project their access rights could be limited)</li>
<li>Regularly update virus protection to prevent vulnerability of data</li>
<li>Limit physical access to equipment and storage media (for example, in the case of data stored on a computer using a stand-alone computer may be more secure than a networked, computer)</li>
<li>Accurate data removal from old hardware and certification that the data was removed</li>
<li>Ensure data recoverability in case of emergencies</li>
<li>Regularly update electronic storage media to avoid outdated storage/retrieval devices</li>
<li>Backup multiple copies in secured multiple locations</li>
<li>Encrypt files when wireless devices are used, and keep track of wireless connectivity to prevent accidental file sharing</li>
<li>Record the date and time when a piece of electronic data was originally recorded to prevent alteration or manipulation at a future date</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Analysis</h2>
<h3>Data analysis is a process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modeling data to discover useful information, inform conclusions, and support decision-making. Data analysis has multiple facets and approaches, encompassing diverse techniques under a variety of names, and is used in different business, science, and social science domains. In today's business world, data analysis plays a role in making decisions more scientific and helping businesses operate more effectively.
There are many software tools a data analyst may use to perform their work. Below are some common ones:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Programming languages like Python or R.</li>
<li>Spreadsheet programs like Microsoft Excel.</li>
<li>Databases like SQL or MySQL.</li>
<li>SAS</li>
<li>Jupyter Notebook</li>
<li>Microsoft Power BI</li>
<li>Tableau</li></ul>
<br>
<p>Data mining is a particular data analysis technique that focuses on statistical modelling and knowledge discovery for predictive rather than purely descriptive purposes, while business intelligence covers data analysis that relies heavily on aggregation, focusing mainly on business information. In statistical applications, data analysis can be divided into descriptive statistics, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and confirmatory data analysis (CDA). EDA focuses on discovering new features in the data while CDA focuses on confirming or falsifying existing hypotheses.</p>
<br><p>Predictive analytics focuses on the application of statistical models for predictive forecasting or classification, while text analytics applies statistical, linguistic, and structural techniques to extract and classify information from textual sources, a species of unstructured data. All of the above are varieties of data analysis.</p>
<br><br><b>Data integration is a precursor to data analysis, and data analysis is closely linked to data visualization and data dissemination.</b>
